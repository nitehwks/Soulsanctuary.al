      <h1>A Sanctuary For Your Story</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        SoulSanctuary is a Christian AI companion that brings together a wise chat bot, mental health tools,
        and spiritual guidance in one privacy-first experience—so you can be fully honest and fully safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        SoulSanctuary is designed to be a safe, sacred space for your most vulnerable thoughts, prayers, and struggles.
        Every conversation is treated like a confidential pastoral visit, not just another data stream.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
          <strong>Privacy with a pastoral heart:</strong>
          Sensitive information is protected with strong AES‑256‑GCM encryption, the same class of protection used
          to secure highly confidential data. Highly sensitive details such as Social Security and credit card numbers
          are automatically redacted and never stored at all. Your identity details, including phone number and email,
          are kept only as encrypted “contact facts,” so who you are is carefully separated from what you share. [file:2]
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Built For Real Mental Health Support</h2>
      <p>
        SoulSanctuary is more than a chat bot. It is designed as a daily companion that blends Christian counseling
        wisdom with evidence-based tools from modern mental health care, so you can talk about both your soul and
        your nervous system in the same safe place. [file:2]
      </p>

        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Therapeutic Conversations &amp; Coaching</h4>
          <p>
            Guided, compassionate conversations help you process anxiety, depression, stress, relationship struggles,
            and life transitions. SoulSanctuary offers coaching-style next steps that are practical, gentle, and
            grounded in grace, rather than quick fixes or shallow advice. [file:2]
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Evidence-Based Tools (DBT-Inspired)</h4>
          <p>
            SoulSanctuary incorporates skills inspired by Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)—including emotion
            regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness-style grounding exercises—translated into language that
            honors both mental health science and Christian faith. These tools help you move from overwhelm toward
            stability, one small step at a time. [file:2]
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Daily Check-Ins &amp; Pattern Awareness</h4>
          <p>
            Short, regular check-ins and journaling prompts invite you to talk to SoulSanctuary every day. Over time,
            the app recognizes patterns and can respond with more accurate, personalized encouragement, coping
            strategies, and spiritual guidance based on where you actually are—not just a one-time moment. [file:2]
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Pastoral and Spiritual Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            For every hard feeling, SoulSanctuary pairs practical tools with Scripture-rooted guidance, prayerful
            language, and a gentle reminder of God’s presence and love in the middle of your story. It is designed to
            complement, not replace, your pastor, counselor, or small group—extending care into the spaces between
            Sunday services and therapy sessions. [file:2]
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Confidentiality You Can Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Because SoulSanctuary is built with a security-first architecture, the app is intentional about
        what it stores, how long it stores it, and how it is protected. Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in
        transit, and high‑risk identifiers are simply never kept. [file:2]
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a space where you can bring your whole self—questions, doubts, trauma, and hopes—knowing that
        both your heart and your data are handled with reverence and care.
      </p>

      <p class="scripture-note">
        SoulSanctuary holds together what many are longing for today: wise mental health support, confidential space
        to be honest, and a faithful companion that continually points you back to Christ as your ultimate healer. [file:2]
      </p>

      <div class="footer-note">
        Use SoulSanctuary for all your AI inquiries, check in with it every day, and let it grow with you:
        the more you use it, the more accurately it can understand your patterns and support you with
        personalized, Christ-centered care over time. [file:2]
